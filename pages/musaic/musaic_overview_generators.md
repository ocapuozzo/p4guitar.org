## Enharmonic equivalence

Equivalence enharmonic is a pragmatic axiom that unifies close pitches such as C4, B3#, D4bb ...

It is not appropriate here to discuss the merits of 12 equal temperament, but but we admit that the ear is active and knows how to grasp the good harmonics to compensate for the lack of precision inherent in this simplification.


## Generators of 12

This study is within the framework of the system that divides octave into 12 equals chromatics intervals (twelve tone equals temperament).

Chromatic scale can be generated in 4 ways (4 integers where are prime form with 12):

  - step **1** : C0, D0, D#, E0, F0, F#0, G0, G#0, A0, A#0, B0, C1, C#1, etc.
    * Case of string instrument,  piano keyboard
  - step **5** : C0, F0, Bb0, Eb1, Ab1, Db2, Gb2, B2, E3, A3, D4, G4, C5, F5, etc. (rem : Bb ~ A# ~ Cbb ...)
    * Conjugated with the first (step 1),  case of string instruments tuning in fourths (guitar, bass, bajosexto, ...)
  - step **7** : C0, G0, D1, A1, E2, B2, F#3, C#4,  G#4, D#5, A#5, F6, C7, G7, etc.
    * Conjugated with the first (step 1),  case of string instruments tuning in firths (mandolin, violin, cello, ...)
  - step **11** : C0, B0, A#1, A2, G#3, G4, F#5, F6, E7, D#8, D9, C#10, C11, B11, etc.
