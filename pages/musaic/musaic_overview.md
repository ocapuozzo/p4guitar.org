### Which scope is ?

This project is located at the intersection of several disciplines: harmony, mathematics, didactics, instrumental play (here in particular, but not only, for the practice of harmony on the guitar tuned in fourths)

### What are the prerequisites ?

An elementary knowledge of harmony is preferable.

The many schemas (and future animations) greatly facilitate access to concepts that usually require a good mathematical level. But a chapter is offered to those who are interested in group theory.

### Why this title (88-Musaics)?

As you will see later, the musaics are abstract, real geometric objects ;)

The study has many "ingredients" that musaics : polygons in a musical dial, diagrams, graphs ... and even projections of hypercubes.

And if these forms are here at the service of musical harmony (atonal and tonal), they will also be observed according to several other points of view: geometry, set theory, group theory, didactics...

As there are exactly 88 musaics, and not a more, in this study, musaics and 88-musaics are synonymous. Besides this study, the term 88-musaics is preferable because "musaic" is not a registered designation and can already be used by others to identify different concepts.

### What is the origin of the word "musaic"?

It is a neologism, condensed from "mosaic", "music" and "muse". It testifies to the strong interest we have in the natural relationships between form (visual, palpable ...) and musical structures (is, chord, scale, ...), with the hope that musaicis could be an inspiration to revisit old musical repertoires and discover other ways.

We warn the reader that the other essential components of music (rhythm, timbre, expression ...) are not covered by the musaic and this study in general.

Historically, the term "harmonic mosaic" had been used.
