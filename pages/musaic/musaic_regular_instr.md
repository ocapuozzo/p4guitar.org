### Strings instrument

Mainly for stringed instruments, when contiguous strings are separated by the same interval, without exception.
This is not the case of the traditional guitar tuning that is (in semitone): 5-5-5-5-4-5, unlike the guitar in quarters: 5-5-5-5-5-5

The majority of stringed instruments is in regular tuning : violins, bass ...

### keyboard instrument 

Regular tuning does not always rhyme with uniform interface ... Indeed, the piano is a *hybride* regular instrument to the extent that its interface is "chromatic shape logic" at the bottom of the keyboard keys, and "C diatonic shape" in the foreground of keyboard keys where
the distance between a white key and its neighbor is, depending on the case, either 2 semitones or 1 semitone : Thus the **correspondence between geometric distance and interval distance is broken**.
