PCS: "Set of pitch-class as element of powerset of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} (set of all PC)"

IS (Intervallic Structure): "Set of intervals that characterizes a PCS. For exampl CMaj {0, 4, 7} is defined by IS: (4,3,5) - so major 3rd, minor 3rd and perfect 4th - as all xMaj with 3 PC. There are 352 distinct IS in twelve-tone theory."

musx: where x from 1 to 88, identify one of 88 musaics. For example, *mus1* is empty-all musaic

motif : set of two PCS, mutually complementary
